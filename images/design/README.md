# Design Images

Images for portfolio projects.

## Folders
- `eco-waterfront/`
- `post-industrial-renaissance/`
- `elder-friendly-tod/`
- `urban-green-network/`

Each folder:
- `cover.png` — project card cover
- `image1.png` ... `imageN.png` — detail page gallery (1 image per row)

Requirements
- PNG/JPG, < ~1 MB recommended
- Covers are displayed in a fixed aspect ratio; gallery images keep their original ratio (`object-fit: contain`)
- Use clear, readable images; transparent PNGs render on white

Usage
- Place files in the matching project folder. The Design page links to detail pages under `design-projects/`.
